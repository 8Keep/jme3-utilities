#summary gratitude for the contributions of others

Like all projects, !SkyControl builds upon the work of many who have gone before. I therefore acknowledge the following software developers:

  * Chris (aka "t0neg0d") for creating !SkyDome (which provided both an inspiration and a starting point for !SkyControl) and also for encouraging me to run with it ... thank you yet again!
  * Paul Speed, for helpful insights which got me unstuck during debugging
  * the brave souls who volunteered to be alpha testers, including:
    * Davis Rollman
    * "Lockhead"
    * Jonatan Dahl
    * Mindaugas (aka "eraslt")
    * Thomas Kluge
    * "pixelapp"
    * Roger (aka "stenb")
  * the creators of (and contributors to) the following software:
    * Adobe Photoshop Elements
    * the Blender 3D animation suite
    * Gimp, the GNU Image Manipulation Program
    * the Google Chrome web browser
    * Guava core libraries for Java
    * the Java compiler, standard doclet, and runtime environment
    * the JCommander Java framework
    * jMonkeyEngine and the jME3 Software Development Kit
    * LWJGL, the Lightweight Java Game Library
    * Microsoft Windows
    * the !NetBeans integrated development environment
    * the Nifty GUI
    * the PMD source code analyzer
    * the !RealWorld Cursor Editor
    * Open Broadcaster Software
    * the Subversion revision control system
    * the !WinMerge differencing and merging tool

Many of !SkyControl's assets are based on the works of others who licensed their works under liberal terms or contributed it to the public domain.  I therefore thank:
  * Chris (aka "t0neg0d")
  * Jacques Descloitres, MODIS Rapid Response Team, NASA/GSFC
  * Tom Ruen

I am grateful to Google Code for providing free hosting for the jme3-utilities project and many others.

I'm also grateful to Julian (for lending me one of his microphones) and finally my dear Holly, for keeping me sane.

If I've misattributed anything or left anyone out, please let me know so I can correct the situation.
